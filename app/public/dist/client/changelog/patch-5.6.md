# Changes to Synergies

# Changes to Items

- New Shiny Item: Repeat Ball: Every 2 shop rerolls, gain +1% AP and find a mon in shop that shares a synergy with the holder. Their rarity increases with the total number of shop refreshes done during the game.
- Rare Candy has been reverted to its original proposition in 5.2, with a few changes: it is now holdable and takes an item slot ; it reduces the sell price of its holder to its previous tier ; it gives -20% Attack Speed and -30% AP. Easy on the sugar !
- Soothe Bell has been removed
- New item: Protective pads (Charcoal + Miracle Seed): +80 Shield, +6 Attack ; Attacks deal double damage on shield. User is protected from recoil and retaliation damage.
- Switch recipes of Max Revive (now Heart Scale + Miracle Seed, +15 Shield +2 Defense) and Flame Orb (now Charcoal + Heart Scale, +5 Attack +2 Defense)
- Fire Gem has been renamed Punching Glove, and no longer has the double damage against shield effect

# Gameplay

- Ranked matches and Smeargle's Scribble can now be created at anytime from the New game menu
- Ranked matches are now restricted to players of your current rank: not below, not above. They no longer give additional booster rewards to the winner.
- Private lobbies passwords are now automatically generated and no longer customizable
- Custom lobbies are now private by default

# UI

- Add a new "Fullscreen" button in the sidebar
- The game now automatically enters fullscreen when starting a game if supported by the browser. You can disable this in Options > Interface
- Show total money earned, total damage dealt and total reroll count in the player detail tooltip ingame

# Bugfix

- Fix regional variants of additional pokemons not being immediately available after the additional pokemon being picked
- Fix total money earned not being correctly updated sometimes
- Fix Spike Armor ability: it was not dealing damage to ranged pokemons at melee contact, was not being able to crit and was not applying Pokenomicon burn
- Fix some pokemons passives not working properly when played in ghost matchups (ghost = copy of a player to ensure every player has an opponent)

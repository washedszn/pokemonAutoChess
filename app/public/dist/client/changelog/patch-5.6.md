# Changes to Synergies

# Changes to Items

- Golden Rod has been removed
- New Shiny Item: Repeat Ball: Every 2 shop rerolls, gain +1% AP and find a mon in shop that shares a synergy with the holder. Their rarity increases with the total number of shop refreshes done during the game.
- Rare Candy has been reverted to its original proposition in 5.2, with a few changes: it is now holdable and takes an item slot ; it reduces the sell price of its holder to its previous tier ; it gives -20% Attack Speed and -30% AP. Easy on the sugar !

- Custom lobbies are now private by default

# UI

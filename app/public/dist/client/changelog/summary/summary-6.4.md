# Patch 6.4: Victory Road

## A new monthly event for competitors at all levels

The new Victory Road event is here! Play ranked games to earn points and move forward the road. Don't lose or you will go backward !
Race to the finish line at 500 points for new exclusive titles. Finishing the race will already be a big challenge, so get on your marks!

This event will reset every 1st of the month.

## Quick Play is now Classic

We are also making changes to the game modes. The Quick Play mode is now renamed to "Classic". It no longer counts for elo gain/loss, allowing players to enjoy a more casual experience without worrying about their rank. Custom lobbies won't count for elo gains either. This change aims to make the Ranked mode the only way to gain elo, to end the debates about elofarming in Quick Play.

## Newcomers found on the road
